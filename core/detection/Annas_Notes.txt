in the frontend only one button for temporal clusters, but there are
temporal bursts and a burst of a specific activity or resource in 
a certain period of time: 
    0. we need multiple buttons for clustering: temporal bursts of events, normal clustering 
    1. Check, whether the both are separated from each other and if one axis is one of them is this cancelled out
    1a. activity should not be shown when one of the axis is activity
    2. how to handle that in frontend
    3. how to handle that in the table 
    4. rethink case parallelism, this might be wrong for the visual representation 

Note to myself: now i work with temporal clusters for both, so tc in wider understanding
now clustering is ignoring y axis completely, would we need that once we have other clustering? 
relative time and ressource is too slow 
counting the best cluster size based on the given data
why all the demo chart is maced as a cluster 
Take out variant

Insignt 
 The current outlier detection implementation is view-agnostic - it always analyzes:

actual_time for temporal patterns
activity for frequency patterns
resource for workload patterns
case_id for complexity patterns

should i extend????
